## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the complete upgrade of the Stellar Arbitrage Platform from custom asset simulation to real Reflector Oracle tracked assets with genuine market integration. The upgrade transforms the platform from a demonstration system to a production-ready trading platform capable of identifying and executing real arbitrage opportunities using actual market data.

All upgrade objectives have been successfully achieved, with the platform now fully operational with real Reflector-tracked assets including AQUA, yUSDC, EURC, BTCLN, and KALE. The system demonstrates all required functionality with performance metrics meeting or exceeding specified requirements.

## Project Background

The Stellar Arbitrage Platform was initially developed as a proof-of-concept system using custom simulated assets and artificial market data. While functional for demonstration purposes, this approach had significant limitations:

1. **Artificial Data**: Custom assets not tracked by real oracles
2. **Simulated Liquidity**: Artificial order books and liquidity pools
3. **Limited Market Representation**: No real trading conditions
4. **Inaccurate Profitability**: Simulated profits not representative of real market

The upgrade addressed these limitations by integrating with the Reflector Network Oracle and real Stellar DEX liquidity, enabling genuine arbitrage detection and execution.

## Upgrade Objectives

The primary objectives of this upgrade were to:

1. Replace all custom assets with real Reflector-tracked tokens (AQUA, yUSDC, EURC, BTCLN, KALE)
2. Implement comprehensive Reflector Oracle integration with all available functions
3. Connect to real Stellar DEX liquidity instead of simulated order books
4. Enable genuine arbitrage detection using real market data
5. Maintain existing smart contract architecture while upgrading data sources

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Overview

The upgraded platform maintains the existing modular architecture while enhancing data integration:
