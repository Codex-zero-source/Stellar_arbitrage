# WebSocket Connection Fixes Summary

## Problems Identified
1. **Handler Function Signature Error**: The WebSocket handler function had an incorrect signature causing `TypeError: handler() missing 1 required positional argument: 'path'`
2. **Port Conflict**: Port 8765 was already in use, causing `OSError: [Errno 10048] error while attempting to bind`
3. **Frontend-Backend Port Mismatch**: The frontend was trying to connect to port 8765 while the backend needed to use a different port

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Handler Function Signature (`server.py`)
**Issue**: The WebSocket handler function signature was incorrect for the version of the websockets library being used.

**Before**:
```python
async def handler(websocket, path):
    # ...
```

**After**:
```python
async def handler(websocket):
    # ...
```

### 2. Changed Port to Avoid Conflict (`server.py`)
**Issue**: Port 8765 was already in use.

**Fix**: Changed the port from 8765 to 8766:
```python
server = await websockets.serve(handler, "localhost", 8766)
print("WebSocket server started at ws://localhost:8766")
```

### 3. Updated Frontend to Match New Port (`SocketContext.jsx`)
**Issue**: The frontend was still trying to connect to port 8765.

**Fix**: Updated the WebSocket URL to use port 8766:
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8766');
```

### 4. Improved Error Handling in Broadcast Function
**Issue**: If one client had an error, it would break the broadcast to all clients.

**Fix**: Used `asyncio.gather` with `return_exceptions=True` to handle errors individually:
```python
await asyncio.gather(*[client.send(json.dumps({"log": message})) for client in CLIENTS], return_exceptions=True)
```

## Files Modified
1. `web/dashboard/backend/server.py` - Fixed handler signature and changed port
2. `web/dashboard/src/components/SocketContext.jsx` - Updated WebSocket URL to new port

## Verification
The changes ensure that:
1. The WebSocket handler function has the correct signature
2. The server starts on an available port (8766)
3. The frontend connects to the correct port
4. Error handling is improved for broadcasting messages

## Next Steps
1. Make sure no other processes are using port 8766
2. Start the backend server: `cd web/dashboard/backend && python server.py`
3. Start the frontend: `cd web/dashboard && npm run dev`
4. Visit the URL shown in the terminal
5. Verify that the frontend successfully connects to the backend and displays real logs
