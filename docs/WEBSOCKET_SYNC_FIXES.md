# WebSocket Synchronization Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Backend Server Not Broadcasting Messages**: The server was not properly running the broadcast_messages function concurrently with the WebSocket server
2. **Port Conflicts**: Ports 8765, 8766, and 8767 were already in use
3. **Frontend-Backend Port Mismatch**: The frontend was connecting to a different port than the backend was using
4. **Incomplete Message Handling**: The server was not properly handling all types of messages from the arbitrage engine

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Server (`web/dashboard/backend/server.py`)
- Changed port from 8767 to 8768 to avoid conflicts
- Modified the main function to run both the WebSocket server and broadcast_messages concurrently using asyncio.gather
- Added proper error handling and cleanup
- Added a "Arbitrage engine stopped" message when the engine stops

### 2. Frontend WebSocket Context (`web/dashboard/src/components/SocketContext.jsx`)
- Updated the WebSocket URL to connect to port 8768
- Improved error handling for different message formats
- Maintained existing connection status messages

### 3. Arbitrage Log Viewer (`web/dashboard/src/components/ArbitrageLogViewer.jsx`)
- Fixed JSX syntax issue with the '>' character
- Improved log message formatting for different data types
- Added better color coding for different message types
- Added a placeholder message when no logs are available
- Ensured proper scrolling to the bottom when new logs arrive

## Files Modified
1. `web/dashboard/backend/server.py`
2. `web/dashboard/src/components/SocketContext.jsx`
3. `web/dashboard/src/components/ArbitrageLogViewer.jsx`

## How to Test
1. Start the backend server: `cd web/dashboard/backend && python server.py`
2. Start the frontend: `cd web/dashboard && npm run dev`
3. Visit http://localhost:5173 (or the port shown in the terminal)
4. The frontend should now display real-time logs from the arbitrage engine

## Expected Behavior
- The frontend will show "Status: Connected to arbitrage engine" when the connection is established
- Real-time logs from the arbitrage engine will appear in the terminal display
- Different types of messages will be color-coded:
  - Errors: Red
  - Success/Opportunities: Cyan
  - Status/Connection: Green
  - Warnings: Yellow
  - Default: Lime green
- The terminal will automatically scroll to show the latest messages
- When the arbitrage engine stops, a "Arbitrage engine stopped" message will be displayed
