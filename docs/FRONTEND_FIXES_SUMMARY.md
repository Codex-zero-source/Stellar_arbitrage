# Frontend Fixes Summary: Tailwind CSS Configuration Issue

## Problem
The frontend was encountering an error when trying to run the development server:
```
Cannot apply unknown utility class `bg-background-dark`
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a mismatch between Tailwind CSS v3 and v4 configuration syntax. The project was using Tailwind CSS v4 dependencies but still had v3-style configuration.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Tailwind Configuration (`tailwind.config.js`)
- Added `/ <alpha-value>)` to all color definitions to make them compatible with Tailwind v4
- Ensured proper color variable definitions for the cyberpunk theme

### 2. Updated CSS File (`src/index.css`)
- Replaced old `@tailwind` directives with the new `@import 'tailwindcss'` syntax for v4
- Moved color definitions to the `@theme` block as required by Tailwind v4
- Replaced `@apply` usage with direct CSS properties in the `@layer base` section
- Removed the problematic `@apply bg-background-dark text-foreground` line
- Added explicit background color application to the body element

### 3. Updated PostCSS Configuration
- Kept the existing configuration which is correct for Tailwind v4

## Changes Made

### Before (Tailwind v3 style):
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer base {
  :root {
    --background-dark: 12 2 33;
  }
}

@layer base {
  body {
    @apply bg-background-dark text-foreground;
  }
}
```

### After (Tailwind v4 style):
```css
@import 'tailwindcss';

@theme {
  --background-dark: 12 2 33;
}

@layer base {
  body {
    background-color: rgb(var(--background-dark));
    color: rgb(var(--foreground));
  }
}
```

## Files Modified
1. `web/dashboard/tailwind.config.js` - Updated color definitions for v4 compatibility
2. `web/dashboard/src/index.css` - Updated to Tailwind v4 syntax and removed problematic `@apply` usage

## Verification
The changes ensure that:
1. Tailwind CSS v4 is properly configured
2. Custom colors are correctly defined and accessible
3. No unknown utility classes are referenced
4. The cyberpunk theme is preserved

## Next Steps
1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
2. Visit http://localhost:5173 to view the dashboard
3. Verify that the dark background and cyberpunk styling are applied correctly
