# Stellar Arbitrage Platform Upgrade Summary

## Executive Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive upgrade of the Stellar Arbitrage Platform from custom asset simulation to real Reflector Oracle tracked assets with genuine market integration. The upgrade enables the platform to identify and execute genuine arbitrage opportunities using real market data, transforming it from a demonstration system to a production-ready trading platform.

## Upgrade Objectives

The primary objectives of this upgrade were to:

1. Replace all custom assets with real Reflector-tracked tokens (AQUA, yUSDC, EURC, BTCLN, KALE)
2. Implement comprehensive Reflector Oracle integration with all available functions
3. Connect to real Stellar DEX liquidity instead of simulated order books
4. Enable genuine arbitrage detection using real market data
5. Maintain existing smart contract architecture while upgrading data sources
